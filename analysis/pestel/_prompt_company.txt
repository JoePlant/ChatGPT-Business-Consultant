I want a PESTEL Analysis on {company} using only current information. 

Make the PESTEL Analysis compelling and professional and sort the lists with the most important factors first.

Start the analysis with a paragraph showing the introduction and definition of the {company}.  
If the company is traded on the stock market, I want you to include stock ticker in the introduction.

End the analysis with a conclusion about {company}.
